## Getting access

API Access is available for all Spaces on the Plus or enterpise plans. The option to create an API token will only be displayed for spaces on these plans.

## Creating a token

Access to the API is token based. Admins of a space can create a token on the settings page for the desired space.

Deleting a token is permanent. Once deleted any code using that token will fail to authenticate.

## Security Notes

**Protect your API tokens**. At this stage we recommend not using the API in public web pages as the token grants read only access to your entire space. We definitely see the potential here but would advise against it until more secutity/access options are available.

## Get in touch

We would love to hear what you are doing. Understanding your use case for the API helps us know how we can improve this API.
