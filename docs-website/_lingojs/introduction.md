Lingo JS makes it easy to get up and running with the Lingo API in a node context with just a few lines of code. The package is typed with typescript making it even easier to learn the available APIs in an IDE.

We recommend using modern javascript module syntax. To simplify setup you can also checkout our template start project [@lingo-app/JSDemo](https://github.com/lingo-app/JSDemo).

If you are unfamiliar with the types of objects and data model you may want to review the [Glossary](/guides/glossary).

If you have anny questions or would like to see additional functionality added, please open an issue or submit a PR in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lingo-app/LingoJS).
