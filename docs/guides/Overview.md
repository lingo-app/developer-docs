The Lingo API is currently in Beta.

We hope this will empower you to use Lingo in new and exciting ways. We encourage you to explore any and all possible use cases but please let us know what you are doing. This will help us understand how to push the API forward. That said, do remember this is still in beta.

## Getting access

API Access is available for all Spaces on the Plus or enterpise plans.

Note: While in beta, API access is only availble by request.

## Creating a token

Access to the API is token based. Admins of a space can create a token on the settings page for the desired space.

Deleting a token is permanent. Once deleted any code using that token will fail to authenticate.

## Security Notes

**Protect your API tokens**. At this stage we recommend not using the API in public web pages as the token grants read only access to your entire space. We definitely see the potential here but would advise against it until we add the ability to scope tokens to a particular kit(s) or permissions. This is where sharing your use case is hugely valuable to us.

## Get in touch

We use Slack to stay in touch. Please ask for access and we can invite you and your team to join the Slack Workspace.
