# developer.lingoapp.com

This directory powers the development site for [Lingo](http://lingoapp.com), that lives at [developer.lingoapp.com](http://developer.lingoapp.com).

## Contribute!

We've made this repository public so you can contribute to it. If you find a typo, or an error, or want to improve the content, feel free to send us a pull request. Also, if there's anything you'd like to see covered or documented, file an issue and we'll do it for you.

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as our content backend, so make sure to read their docs if you need help understanding how the system works.

## Setup

To build the site you will need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Ruby
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io)

Due to some issues with newer versions of macOS you may need to install a new version of Ruby, more details on that in this [jekyll guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#set-up-ruby). Without it you will get a permission error when trying to install bundler.

After that is setup run:

```
gem install bundler jekyll
```

Finally, to build and view, run:

```
npm run docs
```

## Deploying

The docs are automatically deployed by GitHub actions when merging into Master.

## Generated Sections

As well as the normal Jekyll processing, there are some areas of the site where the source files are themselves generated by other tools. In particular:

- The API documentation is stored in the [LingoJS](https://github.com/TheNounProject/LingoJS) repo to keep it close to the code.
