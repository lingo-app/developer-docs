The rest API provides low level access to the content in a Lingo space.

First off, if you are using javascript, you may want to take a look at [LingoJS](/lingojs)

You should also get familiar with the types of objects and the data model by reviewing the [Glossary](/guides/glossary)

If you find a problem, please open an issue in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lingo-app/developer-docs/issues).
