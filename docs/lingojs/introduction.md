Lingo JS is a tiny library for interacting with the lingo API.

We hope to expand on this in the future so feel free to try it out. Youâ€™ll find example usage of the library for each endpoint below.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lingo-app/LingoJS).
