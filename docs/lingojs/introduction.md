Lingo JS is a tiny library for interacting with the lingo API.

We hope to expand on this in the future so feel free to try it out. You’ll find example usage of the library for each endpoint below.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheNounProject/LingoJS).
