> The Lingo API is currently in Beta. If granted early access, please try it out but do not use the API for sensitive data or critical workflows as it may change.

## Terms of Use

- You must agree to Lingo API Terms of Use before using the API. Accepting these terms is require when creating an API token.

## General

- Exercise good judgement
- Don’t do anything that is against the law

## Rate Limiting

- All public API endpoints are rate limited.
- Only access content as needed. Avoid constantly fetching data that has not changed.

## Distribution

- Loading images from client side code such as a web page or app or on a server to then be delivered to your product or service is **not allowed**.
- To use content from Lingo in your product or service, you may use the API to fetch the desired content and **store** it as needed.
- You may not use Lingo APIs for any application that replicates or attempts to replace the essential user experience of the Lingo Mac app or Lingoapp.com

## Revoking Access

- We reserve the right to disable access if usage of the API violates restrictions or otherwise affects other Lingo products or services.
